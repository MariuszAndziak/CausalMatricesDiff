> Description

``* Number of undirected edges: {'# of undirected edges for true_dag': 0, '# of undirected edges for pred_dag': 0}
* Structural Humming Distance: 6.0
* Listing of differences:
Pred DAG doesn't have causal paths from:
- variable_2 to variable_7
which are present in True DAG
------------------------------
Pred DAG has additional causal paths from:
- variable_1 to variable_7
- variable_2 to variable_3
- variable_3 to variable_4
- variable_3 to variable_5
which are not present in True DAG``
